  `<dl>` stands for Description List which is useful for displaying key value pairs, like a dictionary.

  Example:

  ```html

  <p>Star Wars Characters</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Luke Skywalker</dt>
    <dd>Luke is the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, a friend and brother-in-law of smuggler Han Solo, an apprentice to Jedi Masters Obi-Wan "Ben" Kenobi and Yoda, the son of fallen Jedi Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) and Queen of Naboo/Republic Senator Padm√© Amidala and maternal uncle of Ben Solo / Kylo Ren.</dd>

    <dt>Han Solo</dt>
    <dd>Han is the captain of the Millennium Falcon, along with his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca, whereby both pilots became involved in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire.</dd>

    <dt>Rey</dt>
    <dd>Rey is a scavenger who was left behind on the planet Jakku when she was a child, and later becomes involved with the Resistance's conflict with the First Order when her solitary life is interrupted by BB-8, the droid of ace Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, and a runaway Stormtrooper named Finn.</dd>
